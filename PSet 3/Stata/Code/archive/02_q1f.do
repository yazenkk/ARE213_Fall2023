Title: 		02_q1f.do
Purpose:	Question 1.f, PSet 3

Outline: 
When working with spatial data, visualizing main variables on a map is invaluable.

f.i Display ΔLinesi on the map of China’s regions to visualize your treatment; 
confirm that what you see is consistent with the map of opened lines in Figure 1A of BH.

f.ii Then make a map for ΔLinesi after residualizing on Qi to visualize 
the identifying variation, making it clear which regions are in the “treated 
group” (in the sense of a positive treatment residual), which are in the
 “control group,” and which have missing data. 

(You do not have to make the maps pretty. In Stata, packages
shp2dta and spmap are sufficient for this simple tasks. I imagine similar packages
exist for R and Python but, if not, doing this part in one language is enough.5)
