Q3 DinD estimation

3. Now proceed with the DiD estimation. 
(Note: These methods are quite simple. If the commands are not available 
in some of the languages, just code them up.)

(b) Report the Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiessâ€™s imputation estimates for the same
estimands. Use the most appropriate standard errors. Do the results mostly
agree with part 3(a)?

(c) Researchers sometimes use state population as weights. Describe two distinct reasons
for using such weights. For this part only, modify the imputation procedure
to accommodate each of these reasons one by one. Discuss how the estimates
change from part 3(b).
