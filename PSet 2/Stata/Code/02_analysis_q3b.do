Q3 DinD estimation

3. Now proceed with the DiD estimation. 
(Note: These methods are quite simple. If the commands are not available 
in some of the languages, just code them up.)

(b) Report the Borusyak, Jaravel, and Spiessâ€™s imputation estimates for the same
estimands. Use the most appropriate standard errors. Do the results mostly
agree with part 3(a)?

Approach: following Theorem 2 in BJS (2023):
1) Get predictions for alpha_i and beta_t by OLS in the omega_0 
(untreated or not yet treated) population only.
2) Get \hat{tau}
	2a. Compute \hat{y(0)} = in omega_1 population and 
	2b. compute \hat{tau} = y-\hat{y(0)}
3) Estimate tau_w by a weighted sum over omega_q

// why are these ATTs much larger than ATT dCDH? 
// Are my tau_hats right? What about my weights/averaging method?
